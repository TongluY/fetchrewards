# Say Hi
Hi, developers at Fetch Rewards,

Thank you for taking the time to look at my project. Developing this app was a really fun experience, and I learned a lot in the process. I hope you find it interesting and enjoy exploring its features as much as I enjoyed building it.

Have a great day!

# Recipe App

The Recipe App is a simple iOS application that allows users to browse through a list of dessert recipes, view detailed instructions, ingredients, and measurements for each recipe. Built with SwiftUI, the app fetches data from [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) API, presenting it in a user-friendly format.
